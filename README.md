🔬 Bioactivity Prediction (pIC₅₀)

Welcome to my cheminformatics and machine learning journey!
This repository explores how to predict bioactivity (pIC₅₀ values) of compounds using different molecular representations and modeling strategies.

📌 What’s Inside
🧮 1D molecular descriptors → basic physicochemical properties
🧩 Molecular fingerprints → structural pattern recognition
🧊 3D descriptors → spatial and conformational features
🚀 Vision
This repo isn’t static — it’s a growing collection of experiments.
With every update, you’ll find:
New models--regressors/classifiers
Better feature engineering
Performance comparisons (MSE, RMSE, R², etc.)
Step-by-step pipelines for reproducibility

🔔 Stay Tuned
Each upload marks an upgrade in prediction power.
Follow along as this project evolves from simple descriptors to advanced bioactivity prediction workflows!
